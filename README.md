The dataset is available in The World Bank catalogue under the Gender Statistics section. We will be using the zip folder containing csv files. The folder has three files that are of our interest. It is a description of countries, variables and data throughout the years.
From the dataset we obtain around 50 different variables from topics including: Assets,  Technology, Entrepreneurship, Economic and Social Context, Health and Education. Each variable has three values - for male, female and the whole population irrespective of the gender. It covers many geographical destinations so the cultural context is highly differentiated. The periodicity is annual and covers 60 years of data.
Our main aim of the project is to look through data and discover interesting hypotheses that can be easily visible through clear and aesthetic visualisations in R.

To use the data download
